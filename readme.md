image_transcription.py - Converts the image at images/test_image.png into a collection of coloured letters, with one letter per pixel.
image_letter_subpixel_display.py - Converts the image at images/test_image.png into a collection of RGB letters, with nine letters per pixel.
trial.py - An test script that can be safely ignored.
